## Projects

### [Validator NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jdlien/validator)

To improve the UX of forms, I created an NPM package, [@jdlien/validator on Github](https://github.com/jdlien/validator/), that makes it easy to add powerful frontend validation to forms. This lets users do things like type anything resembling a date and have it magically reformatted the way the developer wants. It has no dependencies, is thoroughly tested (100% code coverage with Vitest), is well-documented, and is easy to use for developers and users alike.

### [WebArtisan.info Tech Blog](https://webartisan.info/)

A technical blog I run has articles about PHP, Tailwind, JavaScript, CSS and software careers. It won an award in a Hashnode Blogging Competition. Notable articles include:

- [The Pros and Cons of Tailwind CSS](https://webartisan.info/the-pros-and-cons-of-tailwindcss)
- [What is Dependency Injection?](https://webartisan.info/what-is-dependency-injection)
- [How I Made My '80s Retro-Style HomePage](https://webartisan.info/how-i-made-my-80s-retro-style-homepage-part-1)

### <span>Writing for [php\[architect\]](https://www.phparch.com/) Magazine</span>

I occasionally write for a magazine focused on PHP. My article about using attributes in PHP 8+ was [published in the June 2024 issue](https://www.phparch.com/magazine/2024/06/2024-06-ai-llamas/).

### [MEGA World (Multiplayer Educational Game)](https://megaworld.game-server.ca/)

A Laravel & Livewire-based video game with a complex MySQL database for academic research into learning via gamification in collaboration with Athabasca University. I also created all the graphics assets in WebP and SVG using Photoshop and Illustrator.

### [FunctionalColor Keyboard Plugin](https://github.com/jdlien/Kaleidoscope-LEDEffect-FunctionalColor)

For mechanical keyboards using Kaleidoscope firmware, I created [a plugin to change the color of keys](https://github.com/jdlien/Kaleidoscope-LEDEffect-FunctionalColor) based on type of key on the active layer. Done in C++ for Arduino using lots of tricky compiler operation to achieve extreme memory efficiency.
